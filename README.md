# TwinOtter-analysis
#MATLAB

This repository includes all the datasets and scripts related to the analysis of the Twin Otter performance. It includes:
1. A description of each file in list-of-files
2. nmac function: plots the NMAC of a trajectory (collision volume) 
3. haversine fucntion: calculates the distance between two points (aircraft) considering the Earth as a sphere
3. calc_dist function: calculates the Dx (horizontal distance) and the Dy (vertical distance) over time to asses the NMAC
3. plot_dist function: plots the Dx (horizontal distance) and Dy (vertical distance) over time
4. working script that selects the corresponding trajectory to be analyzed
