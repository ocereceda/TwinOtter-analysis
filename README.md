# TwinOtter-analysis
#MATLAB

This repository includes all the datasets and scripts related to the analysis of th Twin Otter performance. It includes:
1. A description of each file in list-of-files
2. nmac function: plots the NMAC of a trajectory (collision volume) 
3. calc_dist function: 
3. plot_dist function: calculates and plots the Dx (horizontal distance) and Dy (vertical distance) over time to asses the NMAC
4. working script that selects the corresponding file to be analyzed
